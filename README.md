# Predicting heart disease using ML
This notebook looks into various python vased ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributess

we're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling

## Libraries Used:
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: For numerical operations.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
4. Scikit-Learn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
